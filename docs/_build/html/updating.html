<h1>3. Updating the Website<a class="headerlink" href="#updating-the-website" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This document chronicles the changes I made to Christmas 2017 from Christmas 2016. It may end up containing notes about
sources of files and notes about css and html in general.</p>
<div class="section" id="initial-thoughts-and-plans">
<h2>3.1. Initial Thoughts and Plans<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-thoughts-and-plans" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="plans-at-the-beginning">
<span id="index-0"></span><h3>3.1.1. Plans at the Beginning<a class="headerlink" href="#plans-at-the-beginning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="design-and-appearance">
<span id="index-1"></span><h4>3.1.1.1. Design and Appearance<a class="headerlink" href="#design-and-appearance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>I envision a different, more elegant, look than I’ve had in the past. The old site looks rather garish to me now. I’m
thinking about the header being a red gradient bar with an icon at the left and the title “Christmas 2017” just to the
right of that in golden letters. I’ve started to create a model in Gimp and I like the looks of it so far.</p>
<p>I don’t think I want the login to be part of the header. I’d like a separate page for that so that, when someone logs
in incorrectly it will be more clear what happened instead of just having the username disappear.</p>
<p>Also, I think the design of the header will be nicer, and more elegant, if the current memory displayed under the header
instead of as part of it. Perhaps in a box below the header like the introduction – which no one would read after the
first time, if that – does now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="apps-new-and-old">
<span id="index-2"></span><h4>3.1.1.2. Apps, New and Old<a class="headerlink" href="#apps-new-and-old" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>I will keep the same elements I got working last year, at least if Janet wants to come up with another set of questions.
But then, perhaps I could follow her style and make them up myself.</p>
<p>I’d like to get the Story app working, something we could use to make a shared story. I still haven’t quite figured out
how to handle the case where two people are writing an addition at the same time. Can I branch the story? Can I block
out one person until the other finishes – or block the first person’s entry after a certain time limit? Still to be
worked out.</p>
<p id="trivia-desc">I’ve also thought of a Christmas Trivia section where family members answer trivia questions about Christmas and get
scored for their attempts. I think that will be easy enough to program, but I need to find a good source of questions.
It would be perfect to find a Christmas Trivia game already out there but then I’d probably be violating the copyright
of whoever produced it. Perhaps I can look online for Christmas Trivia.</p>
<p>Here are some in no particular order:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://xmasfun.com/Trivia.aspx">http://xmasfun.com/Trivia.aspx</a></li>

<p>Some of them may have repeats, especially christmastrivia.net, but they should give me some ideas of questions and
kinds of questions I can ask myself.</p>

<div class="section" id="local-fonts">
<h4>3.3.2.1. Local Fonts<a class="headerlink" href="#local-fonts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The header font, the one with the website’s title “Christmas 2017” this year is set in the header. Last year it was
Gregorian. This year I might try OldStandard.</p>
<p>I didn’t particularly like that, even in its italic form. I’ll go to fontspace.com and try some script fonts.</p>
<p>Also, I’m wondering if I should name the fonts something more generic, or more descriptive of their usage, in the css
file so that when I change my mind about a font I only have to change it in one place.</p>
<p>I decided to call it “Banner_Font” and it was easy to test different fonts that way. I’ve downloaded something called
“HappyFont” which I will try for a while.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="web-fonts">
<span id="index-6"></span><h4>3.3.2.2. Web Fonts<a class="headerlink" href="#web-fonts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>I thought I’d try the font “Great Vibes” for the banner text from fonts.google.com. I could download it but it might be
better to learn how to use it as a web font which the user’s browser downloads from the internet. From pages 162-163 in
<em>The CSS Pocket Guide</em> and from Google’s guide at <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started">https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started</a> I’m thinking
what I need to do is as follows:</p>
<p id="index-7">In <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">christmas17.css</span></code> add:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nd">@font</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">face</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">font</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">family</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Banner_Font&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">src</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Great+Vibes&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>then, in the header selector:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">header</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="n">font</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">family</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Banner_Font</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cursive</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s see if that works…</p>
<p>Hmm… So far, whether I use it as a web font or download it and use it locally, Great Vibes doesn’t display. Instead it
shows the backup font, which I have indicated as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cursive</span></code> but seems to give me something like Comic Sans. Perhaps it
doesn’t like the bold or italic settings in the .css file. I will comment them out and see.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t that. The problem with the downloaded local version was that I spelled it wrong, it was supposed to be
called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GreatVibes-Regular</span></code> but I wrote <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GreatVibes-Reglar</span></code>. Meanwhile, when I follow the instructions on google’s
site referenced above and include:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">link</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Great+Vibes&quot;</span> <span class="n">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>in the &lt;head&gt; section of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">base.html</span></code> and eliminate the &#64;font-face section above and enter:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">font</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">family</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Great Fonts&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cursive</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>into the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">header</span></code> selector it works as it is supposed to. Turn off the bold in the header, change the size to 400%
in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.large</span></code> selector and I like the way it looks. I will have to find a better way to do the bold text since
turning if off in the header also affected the “Merry Christmas Jim” at the right.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the google site suggested “Open Sans” as a font to go with “Great Vibes” so I will try to include
that too by modifying my &lt;link&gt; tag to say:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">link</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Great+Vibes|Open+Sans&quot;</span> <span class="n">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That worked without any problems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="header-content">
<span id="index-8"></span><h3>3.3.3. Header Content<a class="headerlink" href="#header-content" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I had to change <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">base.html</span></code> to refer to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">christmas17.css</span></code> and give “Christmas 2017” as the title of the page. So far
I have only changed <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">header.html</span></code> to say “Christmas 2017” in the banner rather than “Christmas 2016.”</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="header-styling">
<h3>3.3.4. Header Styling<a class="headerlink" href="#header-styling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Changing the background to what seems to me an elegant red color and the text to a golden yellow was not very
difficult. Under <em>header</em> in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">christmas17.css</span></code>, I set the background-color to #cc0000 and the color to #ffbb33. I may
want to tweak those colors later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moving-the-memories-display">
<h3>3.3.5. Moving the Memories Display<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-the-memories-display" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This should be a fairly simple change to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">header.html</span></code> file. My first attempt was to simply take the section
labelled “Memory Block” and move it outside the &lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt; tags. That seemed to work! First time too!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improving-memory-appearance">
<h3>3.3.6. Improving Memory Appearance<a class="headerlink" href="#improving-memory-appearance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The most difficult part here will probably be in deciding how I want it to look. Perhaps a box with a different
background color (pale yellow?) directly below the menu tabs stretching all the way across the screen, but always the
same height. Have the text be left justified but centered in the box vertically. (Is this possible in html?)</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#add-skeleton"><span class="std std-ref">Later</span></a> I decided to add skeleton.css to the program since I have been learning to use it in my
Confirmation Website. Now I will try to pretty up the Memory display using Skeleton.</p>
<p>That didn’t work, for reasons stated below. I will try to modify the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.memory-box</span></code> class in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">christmas17.css</span></code></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-banner-image">
<h3>3.3.7. New Banner Image<a class="headerlink" href="#new-banner-image" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I’ve created an image of three Christmas ornaments in Blender. It still needs work but it’s a decent start.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-separate-login-page">
<h3>3.3.8. Creating a Separate Login Page<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-separate-login-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>That turned out to be a bit easier than I expected. I just moved the login section out of the header and into the
pre-existing separate login page. It took a while to re-learn how to center the elements by setting their size in css
and then setting margins like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">margin</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="n">px</span> <span class="n">auto</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="n">px</span> <span class="n">auto</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I got this from the css reference pages listed <a class="reference internal" href="#w3schools"><span class="std std-ref">above.</span></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updating-the-gift-pictures">
<h2>3.4. Updating the Gift Pictures<a class="headerlink" href="#updating-the-gift-pictures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have simply copied and pasted the new images and their thumbnails to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gifts\static\gifts\images\</span></code>. Now I have to
update the database to indicate that none of the gifts are chosen.</p>
<p>Hmm… either I did that already or the local version of the database didn’t have any selected gifts.</p>

<h3>3.5.2. Modifying the Model<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-the-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To make the list of questions look better in the admin I modified the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__str__</span></code> function to return a string version of
the date followed by the question. I also changed the Meta class so that they listed in earlier-to-later order. Will
that affect the way they are displayed? First I will study the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">question_list.html</span></code> file…</p>
<p>Nothing in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">question_list.html</span></code> affected the order of the display. The actual determination is in the QuestionList
view. There, the list of questions is obtained as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Question</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">date__lte</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">date</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">today</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">order_by</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;-date&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Thus the ordering is handled by the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.order_by('-date')</span></code> function and I can leave the Meta class in the model alone.</p>

<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">link</span> <span class="n">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;text/css&quot;</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;{</span><span class="si">% s</span><span class="s2">tatic &#39;css/normalize.css&#39; %}&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">link</span> <span class="n">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;text/css&quot;</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;{</span><span class="si">% s</span><span class="s2">tatic &#39;css/skeleton.css&#39; %}&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">base.html</span></code> just before the line linking in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">christmas17.css</span></code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, including skeleton.css on top of my existing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">christmas17.css</span></code> created problems with the appearance of
the rest of the website. Most noticable was that the buttons all had the skeleton appearance and didn’t fit in their
proper places. Also, the gift list appeared to be twelve columns wide. For now I commented out the links that enabled
the skeleton framework. To use it I would have to revamp the whole website. More than I want to do tonight.</p>
<p>..index:: Problems; UserProfile doesn’t exist</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="problem-with-the-userprofile">
<h2>3.7. Problem with the UserProfile<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-with-the-userprofile" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Just for fun, and to check the system, I clicked on a “Select” button and it did not work. Instead is threw an error
saying: <strong>UserProfile Matching Query Does Not Exist.</strong> It seems to be there when I look at individual users in the
admin app but I can’t access it from within the program. My best guess, at the moment, as to the cause of the problem
is that all the UserProfiles Need to be created again. Perhaps I should look into c16Development to see if there are
any differences in the UserProfile there.</p>
