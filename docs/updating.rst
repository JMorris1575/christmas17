Updating the Website
====================

This document chronicles the changes I made to Christmas 2017 from Christmas 2016. It may end up containing notes about
sources of files and notes about css and html in general.

Initial Thoughts and Plans
--------------------------

Design and Appearance
+++++++++++++++++++++

I envision a different, more elegant, look than I've had in the past. The old site looks rather garish to me now. I'm
thinking about the header being a red gradient bar with an icon at the left and the title "Christmas 2017" just to the
right of that in golden letters. I've started to create a model in Gimp and I like the looks of it so far.

I will keep the same elements I got working last year, at least if Janet wants to come up with another set of questions.
But then, perhaps I could follow her style and make them up myself.

New Apps
++++++++

I'd like to get the Story app working, something we could use to make a shared story. I still haven't quite figured out
how to handle the case where two people are writing an addition at the same time. Can I branch the story? Can I block
out one person until the other finishes -- or block the first person's entry after a certain time limit? Still to be
worked out.

I've also thought of a Christmas Trivia section where family members answer trivia questions about Christmas and get
scored for their attempts. I think that will be easy enough to program, but I need to find a good source of questions.
It would be perfect to find a Christmas Trivia game already out there but then I'd probably be violating the copyright
of whoever produced it. Perhaps I can look online for Christmas Trivia.

Here are some in no particular order:

* http://www.christmastrivia.net/printable-general-trivia
* http://www.christmastrivia.net/
* http://laffgaff.com/christmas-trivia-questions-and-answers/

Some of them may have repeats, especially christmastrivia.net, but they should give me some ideas of questions and
kinds of questions I can ask myself.

Choosing Fonts
++++++++++++++

The header font, the one with the website's title "Christmas 2017" this year is set in the header. Last year it was
Gregorian. This year I might try
